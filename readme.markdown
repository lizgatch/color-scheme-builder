#color scheme generator

This script allows to build color themes for code highlighters and shows a live preview . As of now, it only works for the [jQuery snippet](http://www.steamdev.com/snippet/) Plugin.

It uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) and [vanderlee](https://github.com/vanderlee)s [color picker](http://vanderlee.github.com/colorpicker/) plugin.

Plans for future releases:

- import existing themes
- export themes for editors such as Eclipse, TextMate and Sublime Text
- add support for for more code highlighting plugins
- add preview code for more languages
